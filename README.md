## A Simple Flutter App for adult BMI Calculator.

This app calculates the BMI (Body Mass Index) for adult people.

## Features:

This simple project was written in dart/flutter using l10n library to set user language, in the app you also can choose weight and height units in lb/in or kg/cm.

After press the calculate button the app shows the BMI value and an orientation text based in FDA classification.

You can change language, units or clear data at any time using the buttons in the top right corner of the app bar.
